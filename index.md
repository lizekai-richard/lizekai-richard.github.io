## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore. I'm intertested in efficient machine learning, 
such as dataset distillation, parameter generation, etc. I'm honored to be supervised by Dr. Kai Wang and Professor
Yang You at NUS HPC-AI Lab. I have done research internships remotely at University of Toronto (advised by professor
Konstantinos N Plataniotis) and Carnegie Mellon University (advised by professor Alexander Hauptmann and Dr. Zhi-qi Cheng).

## Research Interests
- **Efficient Deep Learning:** dataset distillation, model compression
- **Generative Models:** parameter generation
- **Natural Language Processing:** question-answering, LLM factuality and unlearning
