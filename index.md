I am a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego supervised by professor [Zhijian Liu](https://zhijianliu.com/) at [Z-Lab](https://z-lab.ai/). I completed my bachelor's degree with first class honor at National University of Singapore where I was mentored by Dr. [Kai Wang](https://kaiwang960112.github.io/) and Professor [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/). 

I'm open to collaboration or discussion about any research topics. Feel free to contact me via email: zekaili \[at\] ucsd \[dot\] edu.
