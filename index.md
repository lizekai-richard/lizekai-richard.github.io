## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore. I'm interested in efficient machine learning, 
such as dataset distillation, parameter generation, etc. I'm honored to be supervised by Dr. [Kai Wang](https://kaiwang960112.github.io/) and Professor
[Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) at [NUS HPC-AI Lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/). I have done research internships remotely at University of Toronto (advised by professor
[Konstantinos N Plataniotis](https://www.plataniotis.com/)) and Carnegie Mellon University (advised by professor [Alexander Hauptmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alex/) and Dr. [Zhi-Qi Cheng](https://zhiqic.github.io/homepage/index.html)).

Prior to that, I was a member at [NUS WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/) supervised by Professor [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) on my UROP.

## Research Interests

- **Efficient Deep Learning:** dataset distillation, model compression
- **Generative Models:** parameter generation
